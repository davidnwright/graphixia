#239 The Uncomfortable Legacy of Bitch Planet's Trigger Warning

<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;d be much of an argument against a statement that exploitation is a major theme throughout the <em>Bitch Planet</em> series so far. The comic is itself built around a nod to the exploitation genre&#8211;both as <a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/2016/06/238-bitch-planet-and-the-de-centring-of-the-traditional-comics-reader/">Brenna notes</a> and as the lives of women are depicted throughout the storyline. Like Brenna, I also think that the trigger warning in issue #6 is of real genuine importance, but for different reasons (of course). </p>

<p>One of the things we have to assume, as Brenna rightly does, is that the audience for comics generally, is men. There&#8217;s a few spaces for women but they are few and far between. It feels to me like it should be obvious that comics are generally exploitive of women&#8211;I&#8217;ve mentioned the whole Women in Refrigerators trope before&#8211;but it seems to continue no matter. Women are often shut out as consumers of comics content, let alone addressed as audience members. Conferences where individuals conduct &#8220;serious discussions&#8221; of comics are dominated by male speakers, male-centred subjects, etc., with female subjects often content for discussions that focus to &#8220;representations on the margins&#8221; rather than mainstream spaces. </p>

<p>To begin in earnest, let&#8217;s look at an example of the exploitation of women: <em>Cherry Pop Tart</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Welz">Larry Welz</a>. Here&#8217;s the cover for issue #1:</p>

<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dnw_cherry_pop_tart-239.jpg"><img src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dnw_cherry_pop_tart-239-725x1024.jpg" alt="dnw_cherry_pop_tart-239" width="725" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4847" /></a>

<p>Like Tipper Gore&#8217;s parental advisory changed to &#8220;Straight Outta Compton,&#8221; the approval comics code stamp is reconfigured and becomes &#8220;condemned by the comics clone conspiracy.&#8221; the &#8220;Adults Only&#8221; warning serves to attract the young. In short, audiences consume--and are brought to--the content because of, rather than in spite, of the warning. </p>

<p>Taking its cue from the Tijuana Bibles of the period 10&#8211;15 years prior, <em>Cherry Pop Tart</em> features all sorts of innuendo, cliche, nudity (almost always female), submission, and rape. The submissive female characters frequently find themselves in exploitive sexual situations, which they somehow welcome, and are generally a pornographic cliches. Now, here&#8217;s the first page of issue #3:</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to over-simplify this, but one of the things the <em>Bitch Planet</em> trigger warning did for me was to reveal how entrenched the narratives of &#8220;forbidden things&#8221; is in comics. If we think back to the EC Comics issues that featured horror stories&#8211;women getting decapitated and stuff like that&#8211;the headers for those comics always dared us to read on. </p>

<a href="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dnw_EC-warning_239.jpg"><img src="http://www.graphixia.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dnw_EC-warning_239.jpg" alt="EC Warning" width="648" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4849" /></a>

<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that the trigger warning shifts, to some extent, the audience and the author&#8217;s responsibility to that audience. That said, issue #6&#8217;s trigger warning is itself twisted by the very exploitive nature of the genre. At the same time, <em>Bitch Planet</em>&#8217;s reconfiguring and call-back to historical exploitive genres is problematic given the role warnings played in those comics&#8211 (and films);they encouraged rather than discouraged us to read on.</p>

<p>This is not to suggest that <em>Bitch Planet</em>&#8217;s trigger warning is ineffective. Rather, it is to reveal how impossible it is for female writers to carve out a space in the genre that isn&#8217;t on the fringes. Certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Sue_DeConnick">Kelly Sue DeConnick</a>, herself once referred to as &#8220;Matt Faction&#8217;s wife,&#8221; is doing it with <em>Bitch Planet</em>&#8217;s storylines, representations, and usurpation of exploitive genres, but the difficulty, as always, is in the historical context. I could turn here to "A Room of Once's Own," but then I think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Cixous">Helene Cixous</a>' wisdom about an "always already" embedded patriarchal language and I know I should shut the hell up because there is no room of one's own.</p>

<p>Reading the trigger warning for issue #6 then filled me with dread. While I appreciated and greatly respected the move, I was taken aback by my own recognition that the genre has established such warnings as invitations. These established tropes are a generic legacy that people who wish to have &#8220;serious&#8221; conversations about comics do not address often enough. Hiding in the conversations that look at how some rarified comics represent marginal populations is the established narrative of comics that is founded upon deeply entrenched male privilege as audience and consumer. Be warned, it's time that was addressed as essential history in any discussion of comics no matter how innovative or representative.</p>
