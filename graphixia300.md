Tracings #1: City Pastiches or Broken Buildings

One thing I am contending with in my intellectual life right now is a sense of stasis. In particular, I am starting to raise questions about the critical, or interrogative, processes that we use, or the approaches we take, when we move to interpret texts. I have frequently waxed on about the need for a new interpretive process for commentary about comics because I feel that comics represent a space where the relative infancy of the medium lends itself to reinvention of interpretive models.   

Before I dive into whatever the hell it is I'm up to, I'll focus on theoretical concepts that underpin the interpretive activity.    At the conceptual level--and I mean the beginning, not the "concept" itself--the process of pressing on interpretive approaches to comics is informed by the work of design theorists Anthony Dunne and Fiona Ruby, who speak to the need for speculative design. In its execution, the interpretive approach borrows from--and heavily distorts--Mary Flanagan's work defining critical play. These theorists are artists as well, and that fact makes their work somewhat more practical--there is a hands-on application of their theoretical works that can be mimicked, at least in principle. In short, while I am operating in some pretty silly and somewhat tangentially relevant critical space, I'm trying to make something happen that will shed light on the text under consideration. 

They argue that "To find inspiration for speculating through design we need to look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema, literature, science, ethics, politics, and art; to explore, hybridize, borrow, and embrace the many tools available for crafting not only things but also ideas--fictional worlds, cautionary tales, what-if scenarios, thought experiments, counterfactuals, reductio ad absurdum experiments, prefigurative futures, and so on" (D&R 3).

"speculative design," argue Anthony Dunne and Fiona Ruby, "thrives on imagination and auims to open up new perspectives on what are sometimes called *wicked problems*, to create spaces for discussion and debate about alternative ways of being, and to inspire and encourage people's imaginations to flow freely. Design speculations can act as a catalyst for collectively redefining our relationship to reality" (D&R2).


Mary Flanagan contends that "Criticality can provide an essential viewpoint or analytical framework. Those using critical play as an approach might create a platform of rules by which to examine a specific issue--rules that would be somehow relevant to the issue itself. Critical play is characterized by a careful examination of social, cultural, political, or even personal themes that function as alternatives to popular play spaces" (Flanagan 6)

Design theorists Anthony Dunne and Fiona Ruby argue for an approach to design that foregrounds speculation-- a resistant space that avoids the certainties in "what is likely to happen unless there is some extreme upheaval such as a financial crash, eco disaster, or war" (3).

"Most design methods, processes, tools, acknowledged good practice, and even design education are oriented toward this space" (D&R 3).

They argue that "To find inspiration for speculating through design we need to look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema, literature, science, ethics, politics, and art; to explore, hybridize, borrow, and embrace the many tools available for crafting not only things but also ideas--fictional worlds, cautionary tales, what-if scenarios, thought experiments, counterfactuals, reductio ad absurdum experiments, prefigurative futures, and so on" (D&R 3).

"speculative design," argue Anthony Dunne and Fiona Ruby, "thrives on imagination and auims to open up new perspectives on what are sometimes called *wicked problems*, to create spaces for discussion and debate about alternative ways of being, and to inspire and encourage people's imaginations to flow freely. Design speculations can act as a catalyst for collectively redefining our relationship to reality" (D&R2).

Dunne and Ruby note that they are "very interested in positioning design speculation in relation to futurology, speculative culture including literature and cinema, fine art, and radical social science concerned with changing reality rather than simply describing or maintaining it." (D&R3)

"Design can give experts permission to let their imaginations flow freely, give material expression to the insights generated, ground these imaginings in everyday situations, and provide platforms for further collaborative speculation" (D&R6).

The practice of tracing comes out of the recent renewed emphasis on materiality in media and textual studies. Moving away from the structuralist tendencies of recent interpretive processes, materiality as it is defined in media and literary studies suggests that "

"the way ahead for communication technology studies at "the intersection of media and technology will be enriched by analytic frameworks and theoretical concepts that attend to the material, tangible features of technological devices and artifacts" (Leah A. Lievrouw 50)

"define materiality as the physical character and existence of objects and artifacts that makes them useful and usable for certain purposes under particular conditions" (Leah A. Lievrouw 25)

play as a form of subversion


We pastiche
I landed on [City Strips](http://citystrips.co.uk/post/73760610288/issue-1-the-amazing-city-february-2014-32-pages). I'm sure I'm the last to know, but it set me off. 

Thinking about how comics is ultimately a conglomerate of discrete particulars merging into a manageable wholesomeness.
