**Graphixia Open Post**

**Media Properties: The Intersection of Comics and Other Mass Media: An Xmas Extravaganza**

This is an open Graphixia sequence addressing the general theme of Comics and Mass Media. Anyone can publish, anyone can contribute, anyone can chime in. Contributions should be under 1000 words--no one likes a blowhard. You should feel free to contribute anonymously, but if you want to, you can use your name--or another fake name; we don't really care who you are--it's what you have to say that we're interested in.  

One thing: please do not overload the media library with huge images or more images than necessary. And, people, keep it reasonably clean. We don't like playing with people who are assholes.
