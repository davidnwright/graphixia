The Comics Code Revisions of 1971

Sometimes, it's interesting to look at how the creative process is affected by socio-cultural events that seem more based in political or economic jockeying than in anything artistic. For me, the single greatest thing about comics in the 1970s isn't the comics themselves, but the way the 1970s marked the beginning of the end for the Comics Code and its "seal of approval."

To see these censorship forces as a detestable low-point in free expression is certainly one way to understand the Comics Code and the Comics Magazine Association of America, a group of publishers who banded together under the guise of morality and good taste. However, we might also see it as a watershed moment in comics production, one that separates the medium from other media. Unlike film, comics seem to have thrived not because of the code, but in spite of it. The 1970s marked the beginning of a foundational moment in comics in which the content of the medium turned to reflect the socio-cultural concerns of its time rather than industry-driven doctrines about audience share. 

Art Spiegleman's *Maus*, often help up as the Ur-moment, if not pinnacle, of deep storytelling in comics is born out of the 1970s and the free discourses brought in by comics outside the Code. 

Will Eisner's *Contract with God* also appears in 1978.

In short, just when comics seemed dead, they came back. And, what came back was largely outside the mainstream corporate discourse. 

Marvel and DC be damned. We're doing something real here. 


Where's Robert Crumb and Harvey Peckar? Things are looking bleak.  

It's interesting to think about how things might have gone without the code. Would a term like Graphic Novel ever entered the lexicon to disguise the low-brow, superhero-dominated, repeated storylines of Marvel and DC that were sanctioned by the Code? 

We may owe a great deal to the Code. At the same time, comics give hope that "codes" or any other form of authoritarian control is doomed to fail if everyone wants something different.

Maus came to prominence when the term "graphic novel" was beginning to gain currency. Will Eisner popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of A Contract with God. The term was used partly to mask the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term "comic book" was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.[62]
