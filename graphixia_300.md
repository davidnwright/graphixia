Tracings #1: Towards and New Interpretive Paradigm or Broken Buildings

One thing I am contending with in my intellectual life right now is a sense of stasis. In particular, I am starting to raise questions about the critical, or interrogative, processes that we use, or the approaches we take, when we move to interpret texts. I have frequently waxed on about the need for a new interpretive process for commentary about comics because I feel that comics represent a space where the relative infancy of the medium lends itself to reinvention of interpretive models. Recently, I landed on [City Strips](http://citystrips.co.uk/post/73760610288/issue-1-the-amazing-city-february-2014-32-pages). I'm sure I'm the last to know, but it set me off thinking about the interpretive process and the act of erasing or manipulating originals.  

Before I dive into whatever the hell it is I'm up to, I'll focus on theoretical concepts that underpin the interpretive activity.    At the conceptual level--and I mean the beginning, not the "concept" --the process of pressing on interpretive approaches to comics is informed by the work of design theorists Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, who speak to the need for speculative design. In its execution, the interpretive approach borrows from--and heavily distorts--Mary Flanagan's work defining critical play. These theorists are artists as well, and that fact makes their work somewhat more practical--there is a hands-on application of their theoretical works that can be mimicked, at least in principle. In short, while I am operating in some pretty silly and somewhat tangentially relevant critical space, I'm trying to make something happen that will shed light on the text under consideration. 

Dunne and Raby argue that "To find inspiration for speculating through design we need to look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema, literature, science, ethics, politics, and art; to explore, hybridize, borrow, and embrace the many tools available for crafting not only things but also ideas--fictional worlds, cautionary tales, what-if scenarios, thought experiments, counterfactuals, reductio ad absurdum experiments, prefigurative futures, and so on" (3). Taking this approach to speculation to the interpretation of comics, I want to see how "speculative design" can be applied to comics in order to establish an interpretive practice that "thrives on imagination and aims to open up new perspectives on what are sometimes called *wicked problems*, to create spaces for discussion and debate about alternative ways of being, and to inspire and encourage people's imaginations to flow freely" (Dunne and Raby 2).

I'm interested in how a new interpretive practice for comics might get at--or reveal--some of these "wicked problems" as they apply to comics or the subjects that comics frequently foreground. At the same time, and so I don't go too far down the rabbit hole of absurdity, as I am want to do, the idea of critical play or just plain playfulness informs the speculation. Mary Flanagan contends that "critical play as an approach might create a platform of rules by which to examine a specific issue--rules that would be somehow relevant to the issue" (6). In sum, I'm smashing Flanagan's approach to critical play against Dunne and Raby's speculative approach--releasing established rules of interpretive process in favour of a more arbitrary--and personal--set of rules that might yet reveal something about my approach to--or the apparatus for critiquing--comics. 

As the title of this post illustrates, I decided to trace comics as a way of enacting the speculative and playful criticism I've reviewed above. The rules, as Flanagan suggests, are there only as a way of getting at issues or, to pressure the issues that traditional approaches to comics might create. To some extent, the idea to trace comes out of the recent renewed emphasis on materiality in media and textual studies. Moving away from the structuralist tendencies of recent interpretive processes in response to the impetus offered by technology's liminal representation of image and text, materiality as it is defined in media and literary studies suggests that "the intersection of media and technology will be enriched by analytic frameworks and theoretical concepts that attend to the material, tangible features of technological devices and artifacts" (Lievrouw 50). To this end, I chose to trace as a way, at least in the beginning, to probe the materiality of the comic or, as Lievrouw defines it, "the physical character and existence of objects and artifacts that makes them useful and usable for certain purposes under particular conditions" (Lievrouw 25). Tracing seemed an idea way to get at the speculative or playful approach suggested by practicing theorists like Flanagan, and Raby and Dunne while confining my intervention to some kind of outcome. I'm interested in how we can make criticism tangible, as if I am producing something tangible that is directly related to the object--the comic--under discussion. This way, at least in principle, I am not commenting *on* the text as much as I am reanimating or performing the materiality of the text (understood in this instance as literally "re-drawing" it--re-tracing its production) in order to reveal hidden patterns of representation or encourage different perspectives of the text . 

Here's the walkthrough: 

I started with two of my favourite stand-alone images in comics. One is from Seth's *George Sprott* and the other is from a David Aja drawing in *Hawkeye* (Issue 6). I chose the images because both are full-page spreads and both, to some extent, play with the form , transcending or manipulating framing (and gutters). That said, as I suggest above, there's no doubt that the choice was informed by own aesthetic sensibilities, which of course reveals much about the nature of criticism .

I started tracing by isolating some element of the text. For the Seth image, I chose to represent only the stars; Aja's only the snowflakes. I chose to trace a small and yet abundant feature of the text.  

01-aja.jpg - snow only
03-seth.jpg - just the stars

One thing revealed by beginning with such minimalisms, is how long it takes to amass the content. The intricacies of such details where previously lost on me. At the same time, I saw patterns in these tiny representations, limited by the structure of the page and the position of the gutters or other representational elements in the image--the snow at the bottom of Aja's drawing, for instance, creates an empty space at the bottom; Seth's stars are heavily weighted to the left side where one starts reading, emphasizing the presence of night which is central to the image's meaning (and emptiness).

Next, I moved on to trace only Aja's horizontal lines and only Seth's narrative boxes:02-aja.jpg  - horizontal lines only -- just the window sils 
02-seth.jpg - just the dialogue lines

Then, Aja's railings and just the window frames buttressed against only Seth's gutter lines (or frames, depending on how you want to see things): 

03-aja.jpg - railings and window glass (vertical lines)04-aja.jpg - just window frames
04-seth.jpg - just the gutter boxes

A few interesting things started to reveal themselves as I worked through this stuff. I started to notice the congruencies between gutters / frames / and windows. Nothing spectacular in the way of interpretation--lots of people have gone on about how frames are like windows we peer through in comics. However, the process by which I arrived at the conclusions was entirely different in that I did not approach the interpretation through content but through the reproduction of the image. As such, my process was open to interrogation --that moment where you ask yourself what the hell it is you are doing and how it might not say much about anything. It was a challenge to keep going; a helpful check against the verbosity demonstrated by this post.

So I went a little further and systematically erased parts of the image from the tracing, which revealed the implications of such erasures--what is missing or unrepresented in these tracings and the arbitrariness of such decisions none the less yielding interpretive evidence. 

07-aja.jpg - just the brick
01-seth.jpg - no gutter lines

Venturing further into structures with Aja's drawings, I noted the profile of Lucky, Clint's (Hawkeye's) dog, in the plaster of the building facade, which is important because that dog features heavily in Issue 6. The entire issue is from his perspective. Then, just Clint's breath and bow, front-door lights to the building, and the garbage can reveals a happy face. 

Further erasures included tracing just his bandaids, and then just Clint, without his props:   

06-aja.jpg - just plaster revealed behind the brick05-aja.jpg - lights, garbage cans, and Clint's breath
08-aja.jpg - clint's bandaids09-aja.jpg - just clint w/out mentioned above

Now, as I wrap the process up, I started putting things back together. The depth of the images when one reassembles them is interesting. The ability to isolate and erase different components of the drawing reveals different points of emphasis. 

05-seth-combo-01.jpg - stars and gutter boxes
06-seth-combo-02.jpg - gutter boxes, stars, narrative boxes
10-aja-combo-01.jpg
11-aja-combo-02.jpg12-aja-combo-03.jpg13-aja-combo-03.jpg
seth-aja-01.jpg - combination of them both

The different combinations, coupled with the tracing paper's translucence worked particularly well given the isolated and wintery representation in the two drawings. The images had such depth that there was an element to the hyper-real about it. 

In the end, what came out of this little exercise is a work-in-progress for me. I'm thinking more about how comics are ultimately a conglomerate of discrete particulars merging into a manageable whole, but that seems like an unrealized and heady conclusion given the playfulness of the interpretive exercise. What I do know is that the process was revealing in that it brought focus and attention to both the subject and the arbitrary nature of my toolbox for approaching that material. The biggest outcome so far is why not do it this way? I have yet to come up with a compelling argument against such speculative and playful approaches. Next up: board games representing the narrative of a comic!
