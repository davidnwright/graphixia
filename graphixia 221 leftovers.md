To see these censorship forces as a detestable low-point in free expression is certainly one way to understand the Comics Code and the Comics Magazine Association of America, a group of publishers who banded together under the guise of morality and good taste. However, we might also see it as a watershed moment in comics production, one that separates the medium from other media. Unlike film, comics seem to have thrived not because of the code, but in spite of it. The 1970s marked the beginning of a foundational moment in comics in which the content of the medium turned to reflect the socio-cultural concerns of its time rather than industry-driven doctrines about audience share. 

Art Spiegleman's *Maus*, often help up as the Ur-moment, if not pinnacle, of deep storytelling in comics is born out of the 1970s and the free discourses brought in by comics outside the Code.

Thinking about how comics in then1970s turned away from traditional models tells us a lot about where they are now. Hard to imagine the rich plethora of comics narratives we now have without the turns of the 1970s and the socio-cultural situation that informed those turns. 

The result is the birth of a then nascent cultural tradition that yields more informed readers, challenges the central principles of comics design, and de-industrialized comics production. While there's no doubt that industrial models remain, even Riverdale has to face the shifting cultural paradigms of the 1970s economic downturn in America. It's all ripe fodder for comic book artists. 



Sometimes, it's interesting to look at how the creative process is affected by socio-cultural events that seem more based in political or economic jockeying than in anything artistic. For me, the single greatest thing about comics in the 1970s isn't the comics themselves, but the way the 1970s marked the beginning of the end for the Comics Code and its "seal of approval."

Will Eisner's *Contract with God* also appears in 1978.

In short, just when comics seemed dead, they came back. And, what came back was largely outside the mainstream corporate discourse. 

Marvel and DC be damned. We're doing something real here. 


Where's Robert Crumb and Harvey Peckar? Things are looking bleak.  

It's interesting to think about how things might have gone without the code. Would a term like Graphic Novel ever entered the lexicon to disguise the low-brow, superhero-dominated, repeated storylines of Marvel and DC that were sanctioned by the Code? 

While it's always a risky move to associate cultural shifts with aesthetic turns, comics respond in a way that entrenches them and sets the stage for what we now see as a valuable aesthetic medium. Freed from the constraints of the dominant publishers, comics shifts into new venues tha engage more forcefully with literary aesthetics and production models that encourage self-reliance and underground distribution.

Hard to imagine the rich plethora of comics narratives we now have without the turns of the 1970s and the socio-cultural situation that informed those turns. New York, once the model for Batman's Gotham and Superman's Metropolis is on the brink of bankruptcy. Times Square porn houses are frequented by the cultural elite looking to see pornographc features such as *Deep Throat* and *Debbie Does Dallas*. There's little doubt that the cultural scene is shifting outside comics.

A reformed code, a do-it-yourself ethos, and attention to more canonical forms of storytelling suggests that the 1970s, rather than the countercultural production of the 1969s or the Golden Age of the 1950s, may have been the beachhead moment for comics as a valuable aesthetic medium capable of deep cultural commentary. 

Miles David. Down on the corner. Rise of pump culture. 

We may owe a great deal to the Code. At the same time, comics give hope that "codes" or any other form of authoritarian control is doomed to fail if everyone wants something different.

Maus came to prominence when the term "graphic novel" was beginning to gain currency. Will Eisner popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of A Contract with God. The term was used partly to mask the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term "comic book" was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.[62]
